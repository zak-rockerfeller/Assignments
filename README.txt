In this project, we will be working with the Wine details dataset. To get started, ensure that you have the Anaconda distribution installed and run Jupyter lab. You'll also need to import the necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, and sklearn.

You'll need to implement or find the code for six algorithms, two clustering algorithms, and four dimensionality reduction algorithms. Each of these algorithms is available in scikit-learn.

The first two algorithms are clustering algorithms. The first one is k-means clustering, which partitions data into k clusters based on the mean of the observations in each cluster. The second one is Expectation Maximization, which scikit-learn calls GaussianMixture, and it is a probabilistic model that allows for the identification of clusters with different variances and covariances.

The last four algorithms are dimensionality reduction algorithms. The first one is PCA, which projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space by maximizing the variance of the projected data. The second one is ICA, which separates mixed signals into their individual components. The third one is Randomized Projections, which uses a random projection matrix to project data onto a lower-dimensional space. The fourth one is any other feature selection algorithm that you desire, but this is only available for Grad students.

Use these algorithms to analyze the Wine details dataset and gain insights into the patterns and relationships within it.
